                Welcome to my practice! I am a specialized musculoskeletal and sports physiotherapist with a Master's in Physiotherapy (MPT). I specialize in transforming athletes from "zero to hero," guiding them through pre- and post-operative rehabilitation, particularly for ACL injuries. My focus extends to managing back and neck pain, along with sports neuro and orthopedic conditions.

            <p>
                I utilize advanced manual therapy techniques to help athletes recover and excel in their sports. With experience treating international players in cricket, wrestling, judo, kabaddi, and more, I am passionate about empowering each individual to reach their peak performance. As a sports player myself, I understand the physical demands of athletic pursuits and am committed to providing personalized care for every athleteâ€™s journey.
