                IASTM(Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization) is a specialized form of manual therapy that uses tools made of metal or other rigid materials to treat soft tissue dysfunction. These instruments are designed to detect and break down scar tissue, adhesions, and restrictions in muscles and fascia. The therapist applies controlled pressure using these tools to promote blood flow, reduce pain, and stimulate the healing process. IASTM is commonly used for conditions like tendinitis, plantar fasciitis, and post-surgical recovery, as it accelerates recovery by improving tissue mobility and reducing chronic inflammation.
