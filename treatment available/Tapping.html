                Taping is a therapeutic technique used to provide support and stability to muscles, joints, and ligaments during recovery or physical activity. It involves applying adhesive tape strategically over the skin to reduce pain, enhance movement, and prevent further injury. Taping can restrict or allow controlled motion in injured areas, helping in the rehabilitation process while maintaining functionality. Flexible taping methods, such as kinesiology taping, also improve circulation and lymphatic drainage by slightly lifting the skin, reducing swelling and promoting healing. Taping is commonly used in sports, rehabilitation, and injury prevention to ensure optimal performance and recovery.
