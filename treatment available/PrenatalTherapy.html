                Prenatal physiotherapy focuses on supporting women during pregnancy by improving comfort, reducing pain, and preparing the body for childbirth. It helps relieve back, pelvic, or joint pain through exercises, posture correction, and manual therapy while addressing postural changes caused by the growing belly to reduce strain. This type of physiotherapy also strengthens pelvic floor muscles and teaches breathing techniques essential for labor and delivery. Additionally, it includes gentle exercises to enhance circulation and minimize swelling in the legs and feet, promoting overall well-being throughout pregnancy.
