            <h2>Interferential Therapy (IFT)</h2>
            <p>IFT is a therapeutic technique that uses low-frequency electrical signals to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and promote healing. It involves the intersection of two medium-frequency currents that create a low-frequency effect deep within the tissues. This stimulation helps in pain relief, improving circulation, reducing swelling, and relaxing muscles. It is commonly used for both acute and chronic pain conditions, particularly in cases like arthritis, sports injuries, and post-operative rehabilitation.</p>

            <h2>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)</h2>
            <p>TENS is a non-invasive pain management technique that delivers small electrical pulses through the skin to stimulate nerve endings. Electrodes are placed on the skin near the pain site, where the current interrupts the transmission of pain signals to the brain. It is widely used to manage chronic pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia and arthritis, and for temporary pain relief after surgeries or injuries. TENS is safe and effective for use at home or in clinical settings.</p>

            <h2>Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS)</h2>
            <p>Electrical Muscle Stimulation, or EMS, uses electrical impulses to mimic the brain's signals that cause muscles to contract. Electrodes placed on the skin deliver these impulses to the targeted muscles, helping to strengthen weak muscles, improve circulation, and prevent atrophy. EMS is beneficial in rehabilitation, especially after surgery or injury, and is also used by athletes for muscle conditioning, recovery, and performance enhancement.</p>

            <h2>Long Wave Diathermy</h2>
            <p>Long wave diathermy is a treatment that uses high-frequency electrical currents to generate heat deep within tissues. This deep heating improves blood flow, reduces joint stiffness, and promotes healing in muscles and ligaments. It is often employed for chronic pain relief, soft tissue injuries, and inflammatory conditions such as tendonitis. The ability to target deeper tissues makes it particularly effective in treating conditions that are not easily addressed with surface therapies.</p>

            <h2>Ultrasound Therapy</h2>
            <p>Ultrasound therapy employs high-frequency sound waves to stimulate tissue healing and reduce inflammation. When applied to the body, these sound waves create deep heating or micro-vibrations in tissues, enhancing blood circulation, accelerating cell repair, and breaking down scar tissue. It is commonly used to treat tendonitis, bursitis, and ligament injuries, as well as for reducing muscle spasms and pain. Its ability to target specific areas makes it a versatile tool in physiotherapy.            </p>

            <h2>Laser Therapy (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation)</h2>
            <p>Laser therapy uses focused light energy to stimulate tissue repair and reduce pain. The laserâ€™s energy penetrates the skin to reach cells, promoting mitochondrial activity and enhancing cellular regeneration. This therapy is effective for managing pain, reducing inflammation, and accelerating the healing process in soft tissue injuries and wounds. It is also commonly used for treating joint pain, arthritis, and chronic inflammatory conditions.</p>

            <h2>Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) for Knee Therapy</h2>
            <p>CPM therapy involves the use of a motorized device that gently moves the knee joint through a controlled range of motion. It is particularly useful after knee surgeries, such as total knee replacements, to prevent joint stiffness and promote healing. By continuously moving the joint, CPM improves blood flow, reduces swelling, and helps maintain flexibility during the early stages of recovery. This therapy is essential for ensuring optimal joint mobility and function during rehabilitation.</p>

        <div class="text">
            <h2>Traction</h2>
            <p>Traction is a therapeutic technique that involves the application of a pulling force to the spine or other parts of the body to stretch muscles, reduce pressure on joints, and alleviate pain. In the context of electrotherapy, traction is often combined with electrical stimulation to enhance its effects. The goal is to relieve pressure on the nerves and discs in the spine, increase blood flow, and improve mobility. Traction can be applied manually by a therapist or through mechanical devices that provide controlled stretching to the targeted area. When paired with electrical modalities such as TENS or interferential therapy (IFT), traction can help reduce muscle spasms, alleviate pain, and promote healing by relaxing tight muscles and improving circulation to the affected area.

            <h2>Hot Packs</h2>
            <p>Hot packs, also known as heat therapy, are commonly used in electrotherapy to alleviate pain, reduce muscle stiffness, and promote relaxation of tissues. When applied to the body, hot packs increase blood flow to the affected area, which helps to relax muscles, reduce inflammation, and accelerate the healing process. In electrotherapy, hot packs are often used in combination with electrical stimulation techniques like TENS or interferential therapy (IFT). The heat softens tissues and prepares them for further therapeutic interventions, such as deep tissue massage or muscle stimulation. Heat therapy can be particularly effective for conditions like chronic muscle pain, arthritis, and tension, as it helps to improve circulation and promote a sense of relief.</p>
