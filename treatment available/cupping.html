            <h2>Dry Cupping (Static Cupping)</h2>
            <p>Dry cupping, also known as static cupping, involves placing suction cups on specific areas of the skin to create a vacuum. This vacuum lifts the skin and underlying tissues, promoting blood flow, reducing muscle tension, and stimulating healing. The cups are typically left in place for 5â€“20 minutes without movement. This technique is commonly used for pain relief, muscle relaxation, and improving circulation in localized areas.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Cupping</h2>
            <p>Dynamic cupping involves the use of suction cups that are moved over the skin while maintaining the vacuum. A lubricant, such as oil or lotion, is applied to the skin to allow smooth movement. This method combines the benefits of massage and cupping, effectively increasing blood flow, loosening tight muscles, and enhancing lymphatic drainage. Dynamic cupping is often used for larger muscle groups and to improve overall mobility.</p>

            <h2>Wet Cupping (Hijama)</h2>
            <p>Wet cupping, or Hijama, is a more invasive form of cupping therapy that involves making small incisions on the skin after applying suction. Once the incisions are made, the cup is reapplied to draw out a small amount of blood. This is believed to remove toxins and stagnant blood, promoting healing and restoring balance in the body. Wet cupping is often used in traditional and alternative medicine practices to treat chronic pain, inflammation, and other systemic conditions.

            <h2>Fire Cupping</h2>
            <p>Fire cupping uses heat to create suction within the cups. A flame is briefly introduced inside a glass or bamboo cup to remove oxygen, creating a vacuum. The cup is then quickly placed on the skin, where the cooling air inside causes the cup to adhere tightly. This method is believed to stimulate circulation and remove blockages. Fire cupping is often associated with traditional Chinese medicine and is used to address respiratory issues, muscle pain, and stiffness.</p>
