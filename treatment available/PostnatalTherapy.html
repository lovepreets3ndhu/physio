                Postnatal physiotherapy focuses on recovery after childbirth, helping women regain strength, mobility, and address issues from the birthing experience. It includes pelvic floor exercises to strengthen muscles weakened or stretched during childbirth, aiding bladder control and improving sexual health. Physiotherapy also rebuilds core strength to enhance posture and prevent back pain, supports scar healing from cesarean sections or tears through scar tissue management, and improves mobility while reducing pain. Additionally, breathing exercises are taught to promote relaxation and manage post-childbirth stress. Together, prenatal physiotherapy prepares the body for pregnancy and childbirth, while postnatal physiotherapy facilitates recovery and overall well-being.
