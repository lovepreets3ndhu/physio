            <h2>Swiss Ball (Stability Ball)</h2>
            <p>A Swiss ball, also known as a stability ball, is a large, inflatable ball used in manual therapy and rehabilitation. It is used to improve balance, stability, and coordination by challenging the bodyâ€™s core muscles. In manual therapy, the Swiss ball is incorporated into exercises to strengthen the muscles supporting the spine, improve posture, and increase flexibility. The instability of the ball forces the body to engage stabilizing muscles, which helps in relieving back pain, enhancing joint mobility, and aiding in overall muscle function. It is especially beneficial in improving core strength and restoring function in the lower back, pelvis, and hip region.</p>

            <h2>TheraBands (Resistance Bands)</h2>
            <p>TheraBands are elastic bands that provide resistance during exercises, and they are frequently used in manual therapy to facilitate strength-building and rehabilitation. These bands come in various resistance levels and are employed to improve muscle flexibility, strength, and endurance. In the context of manual therapy, TheraBands are often used for resistance exercises that focus on the rehabilitation of injured areas, improving joint mobility, and reducing muscle weakness or stiffness. They are also used for stretching, mobility exercises, and post-surgical rehabilitation. TheraBands are particularly useful for shoulder, knee, and ankle injuries, as they allow for controlled and progressive strengthening without excessive strain.

            <h2>Medicine Ball</h2>
            <p>A medicine ball is a weighted ball used in manual therapy for strengthening exercises, functional movement training, and rehabilitation. It is commonly used to enhance core stability, improve coordination, and restore muscle strength. In manual therapy, the medicine ball can be used for controlled movements to target specific muscle groups, especially the trunk, hips, and shoulders. It helps in promoting joint mobility and balance by providing dynamic resistance. Medicine ball exercises are useful in improving muscular endurance and agility, making them an essential tool in rehabilitation for athletes or individuals recovering from injuries.
